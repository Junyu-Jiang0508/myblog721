    <p>This is Junyu JIANG's personal homepage. Originally from Chengdu, I graduated from the <a href="https://en.cuc.edu.cn/">Communication University of China</a> in 2025 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Communication Studies. After graduation, I went to San Diego, California to pursue a Master's degree in <a href="https://css.ucsd.edu/masters/index.html">Computational Social Science</a>.</p><br><br>
    <p>please refer to my <a href="/Jun_yu_Jiang_CV_1.pdf">Curriculum Vitae</a>.</p><br><br>
    <p>This is my little corner where I document my writings. I’ll be sharing my thoughts and experiences here, and I hope you find them helpful or interesting.</p><br><br>
