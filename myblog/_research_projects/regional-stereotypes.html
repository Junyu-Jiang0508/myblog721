<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p class="emphasis-box">
    This study examines regional stereotypes in new media comment sections, focusing on TikTok.
    Using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, researchers analyze comments to uncover
    how social cognitive biases contribute to these stereotypes. They find that stereotypes often stem
    from collective social memories and spread rapidly on social media following news events,
    shaping public discourse. The research investigates the theft incident at the 2023 Midi Music
    Festival in Nanyang, Henan, using TikTok comment sections to identify narrative frameworks
    like objective reporting, irony, symbolism, and image reflection. These frameworks reflect
    public attitudes and the evolution of regional stereotypes in digital spaces. The study suggests
    that socioeconomic status, media reporting, and regional identity influence stereotype
    propagation. It proposes promoting positive portrayals on social media to improve regional
    images. This research informs strategies for fostering a harmonious online environment,
    advocating for technological enhancements in news platforms to diversify and positively
    represent geographic information dissemination.
